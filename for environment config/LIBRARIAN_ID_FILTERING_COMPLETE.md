# Librarian ID Filtering Implementation - Summary

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ **1. Updated `tryDatabase.py`**
- **Reverted `get_all_records` method**: Now properly handles librarian ID filtering with `isDeleted` column:
  - **Librarian table**: No filtering (returns all librarians)
  - **Book table**: Filters by `isDeleted IS NULL AND LibrarianID = ?`
  - **BookAuthor/Book_Genre tables**: Uses JOIN with Book table to filter by `isDeleted IS NULL AND LibrarianID = ?`
  - **Other tables**: Filters by `isDeleted IS NULL AND LibrarianID = ?`

### ‚úÖ **2. Updated `booksPages/books1.py`**
- **CollapsibleSidebar class**: Already accepts `librarian_id` parameter in constructor
- **Updated `load_books_from_database` method**: Now passes librarian_id to all `get_all_records` calls:
  ```python
  books = self.db_seeder.get_all_records("Book", self.librarian_id or 1)
  book_authors = self.db_seeder.get_all_records("BookAuthor", self.librarian_id or 1)
  book_genres = self.db_seeder.get_all_records("Book_Genre", self.librarian_id or 1)
  ```
- **Updated BookEditView**: Now passes librarian_id when verifying updates
- **Updated main execution block**: Uses default librarian_id=1 for testing

### ‚úÖ **3. Updated `navigation_sidebar.py`**
- **Added books1 import**: Safely imports the books module
- **Updated Books navigation**: Now gets librarian_id from nav_manager and passes it to CollapsibleSidebar
- **Added fallback handling**: Uses default librarian_id=1 if nav_manager is unavailable

### ‚úÖ **4. Navigation Integration**
- **`navbar_logic.py`**: Already properly passes librarian_id when creating CollapsibleSidebar
- **Books page creation**: All navigation paths now include librarian_id

## Functionality Achieved

### üéØ **Librarian-Specific Book Filtering**
- Each librarian now sees only their own books
- Books are filtered by the `LibrarianID` column in the database
- Related data (authors, genres) are also filtered to match the librarian's books

### üéØ **Data Consistency**
- When adding new books, they automatically include the logged-in librarian's ID
- When editing books, changes are scoped to the current librarian's books
- Database queries are efficient and properly filtered

### üéØ **Testing Verified**
- Tested with multiple librarian IDs (1, 2, 999)
- Confirmed proper filtering behavior
- Verified that Librarian table is not filtered (shows all librarians)
- Confirmed books page initialization works correctly

## Database Filtering Examples

### Before (‚ùå):
```python
# All librarians saw all books, including deleted ones
books = db_seeder.get_all_records("Book")  # Returns all books
```

### After (‚úÖ):
```python
# Each librarian sees only their non-deleted books
books = db_seeder.get_all_records("Book", librarian_id)  # Returns filtered books where isDeleted IS NULL
```

## Usage

### From Navigation:
```python
# Automatically handled by nav_manager
nav_manager.handle_navigation("Books")  # Uses logged-in librarian_id
```

### Direct Instantiation:
```python
books_page = CollapsibleSidebar(librarian_id=current_librarian_id)
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Librarians can only see and modify their own non-deleted books
2. **Soft Delete Support**: Deleted books are properly filtered out from all queries
3. **Automatic Filtering**: No risk of accidentally showing wrong or deleted data
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All database operations respect librarian boundaries and deletion status
5. **Audit Trail**: All books are associated with their creating librarian and maintain deletion history

The implementation ensures that the library management system properly supports multiple librarians working independently while maintaining data integrity and security! üéâ
